# Yield Staking Dapplication

## About the Project

The Yield Staking Dapplication is my first blockchain project. I built it primarily by following a tutorial on Udemy called [Complete DApp - Solidity & React - Blockchain Development](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-dapp-solidity-react-blockchain-development/). However, I have refactored the front-end to make it more mobile-friendly and to get experience creating my own designs.

This dapp connects with a user's Ethereum wallet. The user can then enter an amount and click the 'Deposit' button to stake their tokens. If the user changes their mind, they can click the 'Withdraw' button to get their tokens back.

If the user stakes 50 or more tokens, the Airdrop timer is activated and counts down from 20 to 0. At this point the user is supposed to be rewarded for their stake, however, the tutorial intentionally left this functionality out for students to complete on their own. At the time of this writing I have not yet figured out this functionality.
